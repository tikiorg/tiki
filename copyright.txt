Tiki Copyright
----------------

The following list attempts to gather the copyright holders for Tiki
as of version 5.0.

Accounts listed below with commits have contributed source code to CVS or SVN. 
Please note that even more people contributed on various other aspects (documentation, 
bug reporting, testing, etc.)

This is how we implement the Tiki Social Contract.
http://tikiwiki.org/Social+Contract

List of members of the Community
As of 2010-12-20, the community has:
  * 494 members on SourceForge.net,
  * 242 of those people who made at least one code commit

This list is automatically generated and alphabetically sorted
from subversion repository by the following script:
  doc/devtools/release_copyright.php

Counting the commits is not as trivial as it may sound. If your number of commits
seems incorrect, it could be that the script is not detecting them all. This 
has been reported especially for commits early on in the project. Nonetheless, 
the list provides a general idea.
