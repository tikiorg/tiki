* Usage and configuration

Make sure you have Xulrunner correctly installed.

xulrunner --install-app mozilla2ps-0.6.xulapp /tmp
xulrunner /tmp/mozilla2ps/application.ini file:///tmp/foo.html /tmp/foo.ps
xulrunner /tmp/mozilla2ps/application.ini http://www.lwn.net /tmp/lwn.ps ; \
  ps2pdf /tmp/lwn.ps; evince lwn.pdf

* Note: Running on Windows

In order to get mozilla2ps to work on windows you'll need to install
a suitable postscript printer. Download the "winsteng.exe" from Adobe
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=44&platform=Windows
install and configure a printer called "Generic PostScript Printer" that prints
to a FILE: port.
At this point mozill2ps should work normally on windows as well with no 
changes.
