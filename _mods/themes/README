TikiWiki User Contributed Themes Collection
-------------------------------------------

These themes are bundled seperately simply to reduce the footprint on
the TikiWiki installation.  Also, you may want to license your theme
differently.

If no license reference is found in your themes README, lets assume its 
the same as TikiWiki, thats LGPL.

Remember to include your contact details.

Please note the following desired format:

/themename/README

/themename/styles/
* This contains everything that needs to be copied to your sites /styles/ folder

/themename/templates/styles/themename/
* This contains everything that needs to be copied to your sites /templates/styles/themename/ folder

The idea being you can just cp -R /themename/* /tikiroot/.
