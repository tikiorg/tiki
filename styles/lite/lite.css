/**
 * *lite CSS - "like a KISS ? - lite is that easy !"
 *
 * this is the ultimate source ordered tableless floating full-width or fixed-width fluid 2-1-3 and crossbrowser compatible layout solution ;)
 * the lite.css file is the base style which *should remain untouched*. it is meant to be imported at the top of your own stylesheet using @import directive
 * and the definitions can be overriden to suit your needs on the following lines there... for more info see the project page: http://sf.net/projects/litecss
