  "inbox" where an admin can view,edit,remove,accept the pages.  This new 
  feature can be used to send a Tiki page from one site to another one!   
* [NEW] Consolidated CSS file, there're two CSS files in this distribution: 
  subSilver and default2, if you want to produce a new theme you can change any 
  of these, subSilver is longer and uses an individual style for every element 
  in Tiki while default2 applies the same style to multiple elements (ie: 
  tables) and thus is a faster way to get a theme ready.
* [FIXED] Fixed bugs in the registration screen and now the username is 
  validated.
* [NEW] Forums!, now you can set-up mesage forums, forums are organized by 
  topics and topics by threads, users can post, reply and quote messages in 
  forums, messages can be voted using the same karma system used in comments. 
  Many features are "copied" from phpBB since it is the best forum software for 
  PHP, we copied those features and integrated the forums with the Tiki 
  permission system, rankings, modules and search engine. There's a lot about 
  forums so I guess it's best to stop the description here, the documentation 
  will introduce all the features in forums.
* [NEW] Now you can upload the thumbnail of an image when uploading an image, 
  this will prevent automatic thumbnail generation. Some users wanted this 
  feature because thumbnail generation didn't work or they wanted to upload 
  their own thumbnails. Maybe you want to have a thumbnail that is not the same 
  as the full image so you can use this feature. Thumbnails will be displayed 
  using the size assignated for thumbnails to the image gallery.

  from the history, this can prevent a user from saving a page "n" times 
  destroying a previous version. (Thanks to tesla2k for the tip)
