Tiki! The wiki with a lot of features!
version 2.0 (CVS) -Arcturus-


DOCUMENTATION

* It is highly recommended that you refer to the online documentation:
* http://tikiwiki.org/InstallTiki for a setup guide
* http://tikiwiki.org/InstallTikiHelp for what to do in case of problems
* It might also be helpful to look into the official Manual. Last released
  documentation, in pdf format (350 pages) is outdated at the time of this
  writing (version 1.6 but with many valuable help). But you can get a
  reasonably current PDF-snapshot of doc.tikiwiki.org:
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64258&package_id=68737

* The documentation for 2.0 version is under construction on http://doc.tikiwiki.org.
  You're encouraged to contribute. Current 1.9 documentation still is useful 
  on many points.

* Notes about the releases are accessible from http://tikiwiki.org/TikiReleases
* Tikiwiki has an active IRC channel, #tikiwiki on irc.freenode.net


INSTALLATION

* There is a file INSTALL in this directory with notes on how to setup and
  configure Tiki. Again, see http://tikiwiki.org/InstallTiki for the latest install help.
